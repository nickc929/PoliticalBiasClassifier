Great to speak at GWU with @DanaBashCNN, @FrankSesno, @ChrisCoons, &amp; @SenatorLankford about finding common ground.
Next month I'll be introducing 2 bills aimed at investigating and responding to #RussiaHacking of our election:
About to speak on @FoxNews about POTUS' new #sanctions on #Russia. They're a good start - now Congress must act.
.@WhiteHouse sanctions on #russianhacking good but not sufficient. Congress should now complement/strengthen these new executive sanctions.
Russian attack on our democratic institutions was a wake-up call. Sanctions announced are a good start. Congressional sanctions still needed
Win! #CMS grants Md's 1115waiver to help address substance use disorders. Access to residential treatment 4 individuals enrolled in Medicaid
Greatly disappointed at @USUN abstention. This rushed resolution was 1-sided &amp; does nothing to further peace &amp; security of 2-state solution
I expect to receive #Tillerson's financial disclosure info soon. But tax returns remain critical to vetting process.
Just shared an update with my colleagues re: my conversation with Senator Corker and #RexTillerson's nomination.
#Cabinet nominees must believe in the mission of the agency to which they're nominated. Unconvinced Mr #Pruitt believes in enviro protection
Mr. Trump's pick for @EPA Administrator, #ScottPruitt, sued the EPA to try and block Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts.
Oil spills &amp; damage from seismic exploration do not care about state or party lines. This is good for us all.
Fishing &amp; tourism on the East Coast generates billions of dollars &amp; supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. #Drilling is an unnecessary risk
Thank you, @POTUS, for today's rule permanently protecting the Atlantic Coast from #drilling.
Countless lives and livelihoods depend on the #Chesapeake Bay. We must fight #climatechange for them - for our fishermen, farmers, families.
#ClimateChange is not an abstract problem. Annapolis is experiencing routine tidal #flooding. Blue crabs are threatened by warming waters.
Our national, #economic and energy security rely on keeping our international commitment to fight #climatechange.
One year ago this week, 190+ countries finalized the Paris #ClimateChange agreement. Our commitment to it is vital.\n\
Deepest condolences to the Russian people &amp; Ambassador #AndreiKarlov's family. Such attacks on the diplomatic corps are wholly unacceptable.
Free admission to MD's own Blackwater Wildlife Refuge on 1/16 &amp; 2/20 - perfect time to expose kids to great outdoors

"As our founders understood, if foreign govts can give payments to officials, then those officials can be bought."
Yes. That's why the #EmolumentsClause is in the Constitution, and why @realDonaldTrump must implement a blind trust\xe2\x80\xa6
Very important read by @amprog: "Trump\'s holdings present #conflictsofinterest that are severe and unprecedented."

I welcome this decision to review US assistance to #Philippines given Pres. Duterte's alarming human rights record.\n\
I reject Assad's claim that #evacuation is his triumph. No. We are not fooled. Assad is guilty of heinous war crimes

While Global Magnitsky Act is a key, watershed step in standing against #humanrights violators, I'm not letting up. Efforts must be ongoing.
I co-sponsored the newly passed Global Magnitsky Act with the advancement of global #humanrights in mind.

.@EPA stands for Environmental PROTECTION Agency \xe2\x80\x93 its mission is in the title. Its leader should share its mission
How can someone who's regularly sued @EPA run it? #Pruitt
This Int'l Anti-Corruption Day, I'm proud to have passed the Global Magnitsky Act - a powerful new tool in standing\xe2\x80\xa6
Despite our friendship, US shouldn't sell guns to Philippine police. Trump must speak against #extrajudicialkillings
Grateful to @POTUS for hearing my 12/7 letter requesting pay parity for #military and civilian public servants:
"Remember, water is a nonpartisan issue. We all depend on clean, reliable #water - our families, our businesses, our society" Bingo @GinaEPA
.@EPA admin Gina McCarthy is right: modern water #infrastructure is absolutely critical. We can't just widen roads.
Thank you @POTUS for making the change to keep pay equity for our military and civilian public servants
A bittersweet tribute to the consummate public servant, @SenatorBarb. From myself and all of Maryland - thank you.\

Proud to have partnered with @SenJohnMcCain to pass the Global #Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act today.
Wow. Congrats to @UofMaryland's Cybersecurity Center for winning 2nd place in @kaspersky's e-voting systems challenge. Making MD proud!
President Obama is right \xe2\x80\x94 if Mr. #Trump succeeds, America succeeds. But the opposite is equally true. #cabinet
Provocative tweets may satisfy a political base, but they do nothing to advance national security. A serious, qualified Sec of State would.
Trump is treating the #SecretaryOfState nomination like a reality TV show. He must take his new job more seriously.
How will Mr. #Pruitt lead the agency charged with addressing climate change if he won't acknowledge its existence? #EPA #cabinet
Mr. #Pruitt has made a career for himself out of suing the #EPA. Now he wants to run the agency?
Mr. #Pruitt's selection for #EPA Administrator is troubling. He has made a name for himself by denying the very existence of #climatechange
Congrats to Maryland #HBCU, @MorganStateU, on being selected as a @UNCF Career Pathways Initiative grantee! #UNCFCPI
On this 75th anniversary of #PearlHarbor, we celebrate a generation that defined courage, sacrifice, and American values as we know them.
Today is a day that will live in infamy. It is also the day our country turned anger into action. #PearlHarbor

Heartbroken by reports of a shooting in NW Baltimore. Still learning details, but residents: please stay safe, stay inside, be vigilant.
HHS Secretary must be singularly dedicated to protecting health and healthcare for all Americans - including women and minorities. #Cabinet
Rep. #Price is an interesting choice, as he does not even share President-Elect Trump's campaign promise to protect #Medicare for seniors.
I'll be asking Rep #Price some tough questions about how he plans to run @HHSGov. Must protect tens of millions who depend on ACA healthcare
Mr. Trump must enact a true #blindtrust just as every other president has done. No knowledge of or communication about businesses. Period.
Announcing his plans beside his children leaves many questions as to whether Mr. Trump/his lawyers understand the meaning of a #blindtrust.
While I'm encouraged by Mr. Trump's initial response to calls for a #blindtrust, the devil will be in the details.

Your constitutional rights don't depend on your race, gender, income, sexuality or religion. I can't believe we still have to say that.
Why must we guarantee health care as a right? Because people who can't afford care deserve to live as much as those who can.
When people put their lives on the line to defend us, the president must listen to them, not to the Koch brothers &amp; their extreme ideology.

It is way too late to have a slew of climate change deniers sitting in powerful cabinet positions.
Those concerned about the cost of transitioning to renewable energy should truly fear the cost of failing to do so as soon as possible.
There is not a single state where working 40 hours/week at the minimum wage is enough to afford a one-bedroom apart\xe2\x80\xa6
Donald Trump, the "anti-establishment" Republican, is building a cabinet worth at least $13 billion. The hypocrisy astounds me.
Republicans claim to want less intrusive government, but then they force regulations on women's bodies.
Oligarchy is not just an American issue, it is a global issue. The top 1% of the world's population owns more wealth than the bottom 99%.
There are fair ways to reduce deficits, but cutting programs that benefit the vulnerable while giving the rich tax breaks is not among them.
People ask me every day, well, what do we do now? What you do now is get involved\xe2\x80\x94heavily\xe2\x80\x94into the political process.
"Man is not in charge today, money is. Money rules." \xe2\x80\x93 Pope Francis
"Current levels of production are sufficient, yet millions of people are still suffering and dying of starvation."\xe2\x80\xa6
While Trump and his pals talk about a glowing future for fossil fuels, the business community knows better.
The very rich get richer, the middle class shrinks and 43 million Americans live in poverty. We must stop the movement toward oligarchy.
Lack of mental health treatment is a major crisis. Less than 50% of adults with mental illness received the treatment they needed last year.
Our diversity is our strength. We must take pride in that, not let hatred divide us.
We cannot allow ourselves to be divided by the anti-immigrant and xenophobic hysteria the Republican party has concocted.
We must remember that not only does the wage gap exist, but also that it disproportionately hurts women of color.
Presidents, Republicans and Democrats, have understood that our goal must be to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, not expand them.
Congress must not allow the Tweeter in Chief to unleash a dangerous and costly nuclear arms race.
Millions of us have to stand up and tell Mr. Trump to start listening to the scientific community, not to CEOs of the fossil fuel industry.
While the top .01% has seen their incomes go up 322% since 1980, the bottom 90% have seen almost no income gains.
The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies, not politicians. No cuts to Planned Parenthood.
"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will." \xe2\x80\x93 Frederick Douglass, 1857
We have to summon up the courage to acknowledge that we are in a crisis situation and that bold action is needed to save our planet.
Incredibly, just 100 CEOs have more in retirement savings than 41% of all U.S. families.
Those who solely work in the interests of the rich, and don't address the needs of ordinary people, should not be running this country.
It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers who make millions pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers.
Democracy is not about a handful of billionaires controlling the country and rewarding themselves.
Trump is assembling the wealthiest cabinet in history \xe2\x80\x94 wealthier than the bottom 1/3 of American households combin\xe2\x80\xa6
Have you, friends or family been addicted to opioids? How has addiction affected you? I want to hear your story.
We face a major opiate addiction crisis. Drug wholesalers like the McKesson Corporation make huge profits pushing addictive painkillers.
The rich get richer and get giant tax breaks, while low-income seniors see their social security cut to pay off decades old student debt.
We should be expanding social security benefits, not punishing seniors for the "crime" of getting a higher educatio\xe2\x80\xa6
In 6 years, drug wholesalers sold 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills in WV. That's 433 pain killers for every person in the state.
If low-wage employers paid their workers a living wage, taxpayers would have saved $153 billion a year from 2009 to 2011
Instead of frightening 11 million undocumented people with deportation, we need a path toward citizenship.
Yes, Mr. Trump, climate change is a "hoax." It\'s just an accident that this year will be the hottest on record.
Instead of making mental health treatment more accessible, we make the situation worse by dumping many mentally ill people in jail.
Large, multi-billion dollar corporations should not make billions pushing addictive drugs.  They should be investig\xe2\x80\xa6
Trump's 18 cabinet-level appointments hold more wealth than 43 million households combined. So much for taking on the establishment...
Mr. Trump does not have a mandate and certainly doesn't have a mandate for the very ugly, horrific things that he said during the campaign.
"Now more than ever, working people must come together and tackle our broken economy head-on." \xe2\x80\x93 Nic Smith
Mr. Trump has nominated an Environmental Protection Agency head who does not believe in environmental protection.
As never before, the American people are going to have to organize and fight back against this reactionary movement toward oligarchy.
Donald Trump has nominated an EPA head doesn't believe in environmental protection and a Labor Secretary who opposes organized labor.
We need to change the electoral college.
Trump received 2.5 million fewer votes than Clinton, yet he'll soon be president. Clearly, in a democratic society, this shouldn't happen.
The function of prescription drugs should be to protect and improve human health, not make drug company CEOs rich.
You don't appoint a cabinet of billionaires if you want to take on the establishment.
The business model of the pharmaceutical industry is fraud. They lie and collude to drive prices up.
I've been criticized for this point, so allow me to repeat it: Yes, health care is a right of all people.
Republicans' plan to take health care away from millions of Americans may cause 27,000 people to die every year.
Our Muslim brothers and sisters should not have to fear for their lives every day. We have got to fight discrimination in every way we can.
The future of drug prices in America comes down to this: Do we have the guts to stand up to drug companies who are\xe2\x80\xa6
Tax burdens should not fall on the middle class, which is struggling; it should fall on the wealthy, who don't even pay their fair share.
In 1965, ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay was 20:1. In 2014, it was 303:1. That's just incomprehensible to me.
Mr. Trump may not know it, and his cabinet may not know it, but the debate about climate change is over.
It truly does not make sense that 52 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.
Trump\'s "anti-establishment" cabinet of millionaires and billionaires is worth more than 1/3 of U.S. households com\xe2\x80\xa6

We cannot afford to by led people who, despite all of the scientific evidence, believe that climate change is a hoax.
If Trump is truly planning to stand up for working people, he would not be filling up his cabinet with billionaires and Wall Street bankers.
At $300 generic EpiPens will still cost 3 times more than they did in 2007. This isn't a discount. It's a PR move.
Incredibly, Trump's 17 cabinet-level picks have more wealth than one-third of U.S. households combined - 43 million households!
Is Rex Tillerson, CEO of the largest oil company, going to help transform our energy system away from fossil fuels?\xe2\x80\xa6
Is Mr. Mnuchin, a former executive at Goldman Sachs, going to rein in Wall Street's greed and illegal behavior? I doubt it. #RiggedCabinet
Will Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who assisted the fossil fuel industry, combat climate change? Don't thin\xe2\x80\xa6
If we don't act, our grandchildren will wonder what was so important about fossil fuel profits that it was worth sacrificing their future.
We must end the "war on drugs." Too many lives are being destroyed.
Mr. Trump does not have a mandate to carry out his extremist ideas and we should not forget that for a second.
RT @Carolynyjohnson: Feds accuse former generic drug executives of price fixing

If the cabinet Trump appointed of billionaires &amp; millionaires is anti-establishment, I would hate to see what the establishment looks like.
