Visiting #Lithuania Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis in Vilnius &amp; reaffirming our strong #NATO alliance
I intend to, along with @SenJohnMcCain, lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.
The sanctions announced today are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy.
The retaliatory measures announced by Obama Administration are long overdue. But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay.
The bottom line to this deal: Assad crossed red lines, survives, and wins. Very bad day for America. 3/3
.....for radical Sunni Islamic groups such as ISIL, Al Qaeda, and Al Nusra. 2/3
Any so-called peace agreement that allows Damascus to be controlled by the Iranians will be a recruiting bonanza.... 1/3
If this agreement gives Iran de-facto control of Damascus (yet another Arab capital), it will create more problems than it solves. 3/3
Turkey setting the conditions for Iranian domination of Damascus is very troubling and dangerous 2/3
I fear what is being hailed as a ceasefire in Syria will become a capitulation to Russia and Iran. 1/3
I wish Secretary Kerry and President Obama would stop pushing Israel to negotiate against themselves.
Will be speaking with @FoxNews in just a few minutes. Hope you tune in.
Sen. Lindsey Graham says "bi-partisan sanctions ... will hit Russia hard, particularly Putin as an individual."
As Prime Minister @Netanyahu said: Friends don't take friends to the UN Security Council. #Israel

Hope you and your loved ones have a very Merry Christmas!
Just spoke with the PM of Israel Benjamin @Netanyahu. I let him know many Members of Congress will push back hard against this UN outrage.
I intend to recommend to the Trump Administration and new Congress the US suspend UN funding until this #Israel resolution is repealed.
My statement on the United Nations Security Council vote on Israeli settlements.
Regardless of the terrorist attacks they suffer or the number of rockets fired their way, in the United Nations Israel is always the bad guy
Obama-Kerry foreign policy has gone from na\xc3\xafve and foolish to flat-out reckless. With friends like these, #Israel doesn't need any enemies.

RT @thehill: Graham: "Provocative action" by the UN "must be dealt with sternly and forcefully"
RT @SenTedCruz: I support Sen Graham's call to stop funding the UN &amp; reconsider aid to countries if they fail to join our opposition
Any nation which backs this ill-conceived #Israel resolution and receives assistance from the US -- will put that assistance in jeopardy.
If UN moves forward with ill-conceived #Israel resolution, I'll work to form a bipartisan coalition to suspend/reduce US assistance to UN.
Thank you Senator Cotton.
RT @TomCottonAR: Well said. Trust us, we mean it. UN &amp; any nation supporting this resolution imperils all forms of assistance from US. Thin\xe2\x80\xa6

Our thoughts and prayers remain with the victims of the horrific #Berlin attack. Yet another reminder of how dangerous the world has become.
The underlining dynamics in Turkey are becoming a disaster for the region and the world at large. (2)
Every responsible nation should condemn the assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey.
On @RepMickMulvaney for Director of OMB.
@RepMickMulvaney would be a great choice for OMB Director.
South Carolina is already a great place to do business...... and with WIIN Act now becoming law -- it's only going to get better!
Deepening the Charleston Harbor is vital to our entire state's economy as 187,000 jobs across South Carolina are tied to the port. @SCPorts
#MadeinSC from agricultural products grown in our fields to cars/tires in our factories - are exported around the world via Charleston Port.
Charleston has taken a monumental step toward becoming the \xe2\x80\x98PREMIER PORT ON THE EAST COAST' with signing into law of the WIIN Act. @SCPorts
I hope President-elect Trump won't become the 3rd American president to misjudge Vladmir Putin.
There would be no strong Putin without a weak Obama.
Clearly Putin was not impressed by Obama threat in September to cut it out or face consequences.

Donald Trump won the presidential election.
Now speaking with @FoxNews about Russia hacking.
Will be speaking with @FoxNews this morning at 10:30 am about Russia hacking.  Hope you tune in.
My goal is to put on President Trumps desk crippling sanctions against Russia.  They need to pay a price.
The people who work in the United States intelligence community are patriots.
RT @CNN: Sen. Lindsey Graham: Russians hacked into my campaign account
RT @VeraMBergen: .@LindseyGrahamSC refers to Trump\'s favorite line about who is hacking "If it\'s a 400 pound guy, it\'s a 400 pound Russian\xe2\x80\xa6
RT @Phil_Mattingly: Lindsey Graham, on Trump\'s comments about the origin of the Russian hack:  "If it was a 400 pound guy, it was a 400 pou\xe2\x80\xa6
RT @akarl_smith: Lindsey Graham is calling for "crippling" sanctions against Russia
If you don't go after Russia for hacking during 2016 election you're inviting other bad actors (China, N. Korea, Iran, etc.) to do the same.
Russian hacking during the US presidential election is not a Republican or Democrat issue. It's an American issue. \n\nWe must stand together.
The outcome of the 2016 presidential election is not in doubt.
Now speaking with @CNN.
Speaking with @CNN in just a few minutes.  Tune in.
Will be speaking with @wolfblitzer on @CNN tonight at 6:05 pm.  Hope you tune in.

RT @aikenstandard: .@LindseyGrahamSC, @RepJoeWilson commend Trump's pick of Rick Perry over Energy Department
@GovernorPerry is a great choice to lead @ENERGY. He brings a lot to the table as a very successful governor of a large, energy rich state.

Assad's "victory" in #Aleppo is a nightmare for America.
Obama sat on the sidelines as Iran and Russia went All-In for Assad....effectively destroying the Syrian opposition.
I'm afraid Obama's Syria policy will haunt the region and our nation for decades to come.
The slaughter in #Aleppo is heart-breaking.  President Obama's Syria policy has been a complete disaster.

4. .  I expect the US-Russian relationship will be front and center in his confirmation process.\n\n#Tillerson
3. ....efforts to impose sanctions on the Russian government, there are many question which must be answered.  \n\n#Tillerson
2. Based upon his extensive business dealings with the Putin government &amp; previous opposition of efforts to impose sanctions...#Tillerson
I look forward to meeting Mr. #Tillerson and discussing his world view \xe2\x80\x93 especially his views of the US-Russia relationship.

Joint statement with Senators McCain, Schumer, and Reed on reports Russia interfered with the 2016 Election.
I'm not challenging the outcome of the election, but very concerned about Russian interference/actions at home &amp; throughout the world.
Russia is trying to break the backs of democracies \xe2\x80\x93 and democratic movements \xe2\x80\x93 all over the world.
Don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what Russia is up to -- they're trying to undermine democracies all over the world.
These young people have much to offer the country and we stand to benefit from the many contributions they will make to America. #BridgeAct
Our legislation -- #BridgeAct -- continues to provide legal status to them for three years as Congress seeks a permanent solution.
.....and push these young men and women - who came out of the shadows and registered with the federal government - back into the darkness.
However, I do NOT believe we should pull the rug out and push these young men and women -- who came out of the shadows.......(continued)
In my view, the DACA Executive Order issued by President Obama was unconstitutional and President-elect Trump would be right to repeal it.
Cyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia - not just\xe2\x80\xa6
Newsflash \xe2\x80\x93 Russia is doing more than hacking and trying to influence America's electoral system. (1 of 2)
A true American hero has passed.  \n\nHe will be missed by his legions of friends, dear family and grateful nation.\xe2\x80\xa6
