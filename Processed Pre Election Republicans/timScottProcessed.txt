My statement on nomination of @RepMickMulvaney to lead OMB. Great choice!
Any Russian hacking didn't determine the election winner. But it still must be fully investigated, cyber threats must be taken seriously.

8. Believe in love. Trust in each other. And be resolute in our determination to move forward together.
7. Because although a racist madman tried to destroy us, and we won't forget the scars, what he showed us was what we must do now.
6. We know that love can overcome hate, and that united we are greater than the sum of our parts.
5. We won't ever be able to fully thank families for showing us the true meaning of righteousness; we'll work for the legacy of those lost.
4. This chapter is now closed, but the rest of the book is yet to be written. Your courage has forever changed Charleston, SC, and the US.
3. As the killer awaits sentencing, I want the families to know this..we are still with you.
2. I know it was not easy for the families to testify and watch as evidence was shown in court. Their strength is tremendous.
1. Today's verdict won't bring back those lost, but it ensures the families of those lost will see justice come to this evil man.
