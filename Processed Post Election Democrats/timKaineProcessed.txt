Raising taxes on middle class families isn\'t the right kind of "tax reform." We need to invest in economic growth\xe2\x80\x94not hurt working families.
TIME: "One-third of middle class families could end up paying more under the GOP tax plan, experts say."
Washington Post: "Some middle-class Americans would pay higher taxes under GOP bill, despite Trump\'s promise."
NYT: The GOP plan "would actually raise taxes on nearly 13 million tax filers who earn $100,000 a year or less."
Vox: The GOP plan "would actually result in a sizable tax increase" for the average U.S. household over time.
We hear a lot about how the GOP tax plan gives benefits to the top\xe2\x80\x94but ya know what? It also could *raise* middle class taxes for millions.
