...sacrifices made by others on Bergdahl's behalf, this sentence in my view falls short of the gravity of the offense.
Given the nature of the crime and the sacrifices made by others on #Bergdahl's behalf...

Mr. Saipov is now lawyered up &amp; we lost our ability to gather military intelligence abt terror ties, plots, radicalization efforts, &amp; more.
Mr. President you had power to declare Saipov and captured \xe2\x80\x98Solders of the Caliphate' enemy combatants without ANY changes to current law
Hard to catch \xe2\x80\x98Soldiers of the Caliphate' alive.  \n\nYou must take advantage of the military intelligence opportunities they provide.
Trumps DOJ calls him a common criminal just like Obama DOJ.  \n\nSaipov should have been held as an enemy combatant.
Unfortunately, Trump Administration continues the same practice as Obama treating \xe2\x80\x98Soldiers of the Caliphate' like common criminals.
