It is a simple, but important, change they could easily make. The ball is in their court.
I have told the White House and GOP leaders that if they simply stick to their own caps, the rest of the Budget is fine and I'll vote yes.
Senators McCain and Graham are torpedoing the budget by insisting on busting the budget caps for more spending.
