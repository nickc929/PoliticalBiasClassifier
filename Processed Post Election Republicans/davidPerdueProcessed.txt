Washington needs a sense of urgency like it's never had before to get tax done by the end of the year.
President Trump is moving at a business pace, not a bureaucratic pace. The American people expect Congress to do the same.
.@SenJohnKennedy: Changing the tax code is about letting you keep more of your hard-earned dollars.
.@SenatorRounds: To tackle the national debt, we've got to grow the economy. That's what changing the tax code will do.
Simplifying the individual code = relief to working Americans &amp; their families &amp; could mean a $4-9k increase in wage &amp; salary income.
.@SteveDaines: "This is about a wage raise through tax cuts."
.@SenTedCruz is right: changing the tax code is about creating more opportunity for American workers and families.
This will lead to investment, jobs, and higher wages.

The RAISE Act would eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery &amp; move us to a merit-based system that's pro-worker, pro-growth, &amp; proven to work.
Yesterday's tragic attack was the 5th terrorist incident involving a Diversity Visa Lottery recipient since 2001.
The world's largest supporter of terrorism, Iran, is the 3rd highest recipient of Diversity Lottery Visas.
Our immigration laws are outdated &amp; don't meet our country's needs. Modernizing them is a national security issue.
