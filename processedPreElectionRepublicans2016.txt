I intend to, along with @SenJohnMcCain, lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.
The sanctions announced today are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy.
The retaliatory measures announced by Obama Administration are long overdue. But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay.
The bottom line to this deal: Assad crossed red lines, survives, and wins. Very bad day for America. 3/3
.....for radical Sunni Islamic groups such as ISIL, Al Qaeda, and Al Nusra. 2/3
Any so-called peace agreement that allows Damascus to be controlled by the Iranians will be a recruiting bonanza.... 1/3
If this agreement gives Iran de-facto control of Damascus (yet another Arab capital), it will create more problems than it solves. 3/3
Turkey setting the conditions for Iranian domination of Damascus is very troubling and dangerous 2/3
I fear what is being hailed as a ceasefire in Syria will become a capitulation to Russia and Iran. 1/3
I wish Secretary Kerry and President Obama would stop pushing Israel to negotiate against themselves.

Regardless of the terrorist attacks they suffer or the number of rockets fired their way, in the United Nations Israel is always the bad guy

If you don't go after Russia for hacking during 2016 election you're inviting other bad actors (China, N. Korea, Iran, etc.) to do the same.
