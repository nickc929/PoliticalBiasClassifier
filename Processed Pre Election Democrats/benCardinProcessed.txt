Next month I'll be introducing 2 bills aimed at investigating and responding to #RussiaHacking of our election:
About to speak on @FoxNews about POTUS' new #sanctions on #Russia. They're a good start - now Congress must act.
.@WhiteHouse sanctions on #russianhacking good but not sufficient. Congress should now complement/strengthen these new executive sanctions.
Russian attack on our democratic institutions was a wake-up call. Sanctions announced are a good start. Congressional sanctions still needed
Win! #CMS grants Md's 1115waiver to help address substance use disorders. Access to residential treatment 4 individuals enrolled in Medicaid
Greatly disappointed at @USUN abstention. This rushed resolution was 1-sided &amp; does nothing to further peace &amp; security of 2-state solution
I expect to receive #Tillerson's financial disclosure info soon. But tax returns remain critical to vetting process.
Just shared an update with my colleagues re: my conversation with Senator Corker and #RexTillerson's nomination.
#Cabinet nominees must believe in the mission of the agency to which they're nominated. Unconvinced Mr #Pruitt believes in enviro protection
Mr. Trump's pick for @EPA Administrator, #ScottPruitt, sued the EPA to try and block Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts.
Oil spills &amp; damage from seismic exploration do not care about state or party lines. This is good for us all.
Fishing &amp; tourism on the East Coast generates billions of dollars &amp; supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. #Drilling is an unnecessary risk
Thank you, @POTUS, for today's rule permanently protecting the Atlantic Coast from #drilling.
Countless lives and livelihoods depend on the #Chesapeake Bay. We must fight #climatechange for them - for our fishermen, farmers, families.
#ClimateChange is not an abstract problem. Annapolis is experiencing routine tidal #flooding. Blue crabs are threatened by warming waters.
Our national, #economic and energy security rely on keeping our international commitment to fight #climatechange.
One year ago this week, 190+ countries finalized the Paris #ClimateChange agreement. Our commitment to it is vital.\n\
Deepest condolences to the Russian people &amp; Ambassador #AndreiKarlov's family. Such attacks on the diplomatic corps are wholly unacceptable.
Free admission to MD's own Blackwater Wildlife Refuge on 1/16 &amp; 2/20 - perfect time to expose kids to great outdoors
Happy to learn from @USFWS 31 refuges, like MD's Blackwater Wildlife Refuge, will offer free admission certain days:
"As our founders understood, if foreign govts can give payments to officials, then those officials can be bought."
Yes. That's why the #EmolumentsClause is in the Constitution, and why @realDonaldTrump must implement a blind trust\xe2\x80\xa6
Very important read by @amprog: "Trump\'s holdings present #conflictsofinterest that are severe and unprecedented."
.@POTUS: "#RussianInterference investigation must be independent &amp; nonpartisan." Yes. This is about US sovereignty.
I welcome this decision to review US assistance to #Philippines given Pres. Duterte's alarming human rights record.\n\
I reject Assad's claim that #evacuation is his triumph. No. We are not fooled. Assad is guilty of heinous war crimes
Relieved some civilians have been evacuated from #Aleppo. We must maintain pressure on Assad, Russia, Iran to comply with the #ceasefire.
This new funding rule will help ensure nationwide access to reproductive healthcare for all women. #ThanksObama \
Proud to be co-sponsoring this bill. Democrat or Republican, no President is above the law -- and we must avoid a\xe2\x80\xa6
MD, it's the LAST DAY to sign up for 2017 health insurance. Enroll and see if you qualify for help here:
.@realDonaldTrump has legal &amp; moral obligation to divest business-related #conflictsofinterest before inauguration.
It is complex. Please address your potential #ConstitutionalCrisis before you take your oath to defend Constitution\xe2\x80\xa6
As 1000s gather nationwide in quiet vigil\xe2\x80\x94remembering those lost to #GunViolence, we're reminded to HonorWithAction\xe2\x80\xa6
.@POTUS is right. We owe much of our success as a nation to the passion and commitment of our public servants. Than\xe2\x80\xa6
RT @mitchellreports: .@SenatorCardin: For the American people there needs to be an independent, non-partisan investigation into Russian hac\xe2\x80\xa6
Look forward to #Tillerson's answers to my concerns and assessing his readiness to represent not stakeholders, but the American people.
Anticipate meeting #Tillerson, but deeply troubled by his history w/ Vladimir #Putin &amp; opposition to sanctions on Russia. #SecretaryOfState
Maryland, #GetCovered by 12/15 to make sure you're covered on January 1. Find free, in-person sign up help here:
9 in 10 Marylanders receive financial help with @MarylandConnect health insurance. See if you qualify before 12/15!\xe2\x80\xa6
Maryland: Reminder, only 3 DAYS left to enroll in 2017 health insurance with our own @MarylandConnect. #GetCovered:\xe2\x80\xa6
If Tillerson is the nom, I look forward to a meeting &amp; hearing process. But anyone who has opposed our Russia sanctions is problematic
New @urbaninstitute study shows GOP's plan to repeal #ACA would leave 30 MILLION Americans uninsured. Devastating.
100 new companies signed the Equal Pay Pledge. Good. Now let's pass #EqualRightsAmendment &amp; make gender equality law
On CNN speaking about the latest evidence of #russianhacking. \n\nRussia is not our friend. They attacked us - we must take approriate action.
Relieved #AzzaSoliman is out on bail. Very concerned by her arrest &amp; accusations against her. #NGOs_Not_Criminals #Egypt #HumanRightsDay
This #HumanRightsDay, let's recommit to staying vigilant and not allowing human rights violations to be excused or go unpunished. Join me?
While Global Magnitsky Act is a key, watershed step in standing against #humanrights violators, I'm not letting up. Efforts must be ongoing.
I co-sponsored the newly passed Global Magnitsky Act with the advancement of global #humanrights in mind.
#HumanRightsDay reminds us to never take our basic freedoms for granted. Steadfastly committed to protecting those rights both here &amp; abroad
.@EPA stands for Environmental PROTECTION Agency \xe2\x80\x93 its mission is in the title. Its leader should share its mission
How can someone who's regularly sued @EPA run it? #Pruitt
This Int'l Anti-Corruption Day, I'm proud to have passed the Global Magnitsky Act - a powerful new tool in standing\xe2\x80\xa6
Despite our friendship, US shouldn't sell guns to Philippine police. Trump must speak against #extrajudicialkillings
Grateful to @POTUS for hearing my 12/7 letter requesting pay parity for #military and civilian public servants:
"Remember, water is a nonpartisan issue. We all depend on clean, reliable #water - our families, our businesses, our society" Bingo @GinaEPA
.@EPA admin Gina McCarthy is right: modern water #infrastructure is absolutely critical. We can't just widen roads.
Thank you @POTUS for making the change to keep pay equity for our military and civilian public servants
A bittersweet tribute to the consummate public servant, @SenatorBarb. From myself and all of Maryland - thank you.\
Very happy the #Gambia govt has released my constituent, Fanta Jawara, from jail. Hope she can travel home soon.
This legislation is a reminder to those who have the courage to stand up to #corruption and #humanrights abuses tha\xe2\x80\xa6
Proud to have partnered with @SenJohnMcCain to pass the Global #Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act today.
Wow. Congrats to @UofMaryland's Cybersecurity Center for winning 2nd place in @kaspersky's e-voting systems challenge. Making MD proud!
President Obama is right \xe2\x80\x94 if Mr. #Trump succeeds, America succeeds. But the opposite is equally true. #cabinet
Provocative tweets may satisfy a political base, but they do nothing to advance national security. A serious, qualified Sec of State would.
Trump is treating the #SecretaryOfState nomination like a reality TV show. He must take his new job more seriously.
How will Mr. #Pruitt lead the agency charged with addressing climate change if he won't acknowledge its existence? #EPA #cabinet
Mr. #Pruitt has made a career for himself out of suing the #EPA. Now he wants to run the agency?
Mr. #Pruitt's selection for #EPA Administrator is troubling. He has made a name for himself by denying the very existence of #climatechange
Congrats to Maryland #HBCU, @MorganStateU, on being selected as a @UNCF Career Pathways Initiative grantee! #UNCFCPI
On this 75th anniversary of #PearlHarbor, we celebrate a generation that defined courage, sacrifice, and American values as we know them.
Today is a day that will live in infamy. It is also the day our country turned anger into action. #PearlHarbor
Above all, @SenatorBarb proved being bipartisan and tenacious are productive qualities. #Maryland owes her much &amp; I wish her only the best.
.@SenatorBarb has fought tirelessly for the welfare of all Americans, but especially for women, minority groups and disadvantaged children.
.@SenatorBarb has been one of the most dedicated, effective public servants #Maryland has ever seen. We will miss her dearly in the Senate.
Speaking on the floor of the Senate about @SenatorBarb's remarkable legacy of service and leadership. Watch live:
RT @MarylandConnect: Just 10 days left! Renew or change plans for 2017 now:
#Maryland: Just over 1 week left to enroll in @MarylandConnect for 2017 #healthcare coverage. Don't miss the window\xe2\x80\xa6
Environmental protection is not a partisan issue. Thousands of jobs and families - of all affiliations - depend on a healthy #ChesapeakeBay.
Meeting with @chesapeakebay and Maryland's environmental leaders about the future of the #ChesapeakeBay. A lot of h\xe2\x80\xa6
We cannot erase decades of institutionalized homophobia but we can ensure injustices against #LGBT are not repeated
I'm speaking live with @wolfblitzer on CNN in 10 mins to say more about Mr. Trump's #cabinetpicks and my concerns re: conflicts of interest.
I believe in the #cabinet confirm. process and hearing nominees; let us still be clear Gen #Mattis would require change of law, not "waiver"
#Maryland had 1,334 new #HIV cases in 2015, the 3rd highest rate per capita in the nation. We cannot rest on our laurels. I certainly won't.
This #WorldAIDSDay we must also recommit to strengthening civil society and creating an #AIDS-free generation. Publ\xe2\x80\xa6
Today we recognize #WorldAIDSDay &amp; need to recommit to @PEPFAR, which has helped #AIDS fatalities fall 45% globally.
Heartbroken by reports of a shooting in NW Baltimore. Still learning details, but residents: please stay safe, stay inside, be vigilant.
HHS Secretary must be singularly dedicated to protecting health and healthcare for all Americans - including women and minorities. #Cabinet
Rep. #Price is an interesting choice, as he does not even share President-Elect Trump's campaign promise to protect #Medicare for seniors.
I'll be asking Rep #Price some tough questions about how he plans to run @HHSGov. Must protect tens of millions who depend on ACA healthcare
Mr. Trump must enact a true #blindtrust just as every other president has done. No knowledge of or communication about businesses. Period.
Announcing his plans beside his children leaves many questions as to whether Mr. Trump/his lawyers understand the meaning of a #blindtrust.
While I'm encouraged by Mr. Trump's initial response to calls for a #blindtrust, the devil will be in the details.
