Takata's claimed financial distress more reason for criminal charges against corporate officers culpable for lies &amp; deadly defective airbags
Civil settlement inadequate against Takata\xe2\x80\x94only stringent criminal penalties will punish and deter its contempt for life and laws.
Criminal plea&amp;stiff punishment necessary against Takata&amp;individual officers for lethal airbags&amp;lies\xe2\x80\x94thanks @NYTimes.
PEOTUS Trump will be responsible for rigorously enforcing these sanctions\xe2\x80\x94a responsibility I hope he takes with the seriousness it deserves.
American people deserve a strong, immediate bipartisan investigation to reveal full scope of Russian aggression &amp; determine additional steps
Today's sanctions are a well-deserved, long overdue, &amp; only the beginning of necessary action in response to Russian cyberattacks on the US.
I will work hard to assure that support for Israel is protected &amp; done so w/bipartisan support:
Amidst terrorist attacks, economic boycotts &amp; the most virulent anti-Semitism, Israel has made enormous sacrifices in pursuit of peace.
While I respect US efforts to seek a 2 state solution, I continue to be disappointed by the recent UN Security Council abstention.
Wishing a #MerryChristmas, #HappyHanukkah, &amp; joyous, safe holidays to all.

Russia's role in the unconscionable slaughter of civilians in #Aleppo must stop\xe2\x80\x94their actions are unacceptable.
The investigation of Russia's efforts to interfere in our elections should be done soon &amp; with bipartisan support.
I'll continue to fight for the F-35 program that is essential to US air superiority &amp; the defense of our NATO allies across the globe.
Reducing unnecessary costs is a welcome &amp; important effort, but it cannot detract from our continued commitment to JSF &amp; our nat'l defense.
The #opioidepidemic has devastated families &amp; communities across #CT. Congress must hear their stories &amp; provide the fed support they need.

Urged Senate to pass a new, broad-reaching measure that will provide much-needed support &amp; benefits to #veterans:
For PEOTUS Trump to threaten enforcement against a news company because he doesn't like the coverage is a threat to the First Amendment.
News companies should not succumb to PEOTUS Trump's threatened abuse of power by letting it influence coverage.
