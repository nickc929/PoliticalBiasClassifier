Time for Congress to do its job on Russia as well-convene a special, select Committee to investigate Russian hacking.
.@realdonaldtrump should commit to fully enforcing Russia sanctions- anything less will project weakness &amp; embolden cyber attackers.
These sanctions send a clear message- that Russia's actions were an attack on our democracy.
Sanctions against Russia are one part of holding Putin accountable for his actions to interfere w/ our election.
Casey Statement on Sanctions on Russia After Cyberattacks
to all those celebrating Kwanzaa- my thoughts are w/ you. May this be a joyous time for you &amp; your family
countering violence against women abroad is key to U.S. national security. New admin should protect these programs
I commend the work of the Church World Service as they ready homes in Lancaster for Syrian refugees this Christmas
Happy first night of Hanukkah and a Merry Christmas Eve to all those celebrating this evening!
Resolutions like the one offered at the  UN Security Council this week have the potential to move peace further from our reach.
I called on Admin to veto UN resolution on Israel. I am disappointed that the U.S. delegation did not use veto power on security council
great talking w/ @AliVelshi on @MSNBC this afternoon. Incoming admin must counter Russia's aggression in Ukraine, Syria &amp; throughout world
I have pushed for this repeatedly and will continue to do so. see here:

reports that @realDonaldTrump will nominate Mr. Tillerson as #SecretaryOfState raise Qs about whether new Admin will stand up to Putin
.@realDonaldTrump fascination w/ Putin, combined w/ Tillerson's unusual relationship w/ Putin and #russianhacking story raise profound Qs
I strongly supported sanctioning Russia following invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Tillerson opposed those sanctions #SecretaryOfState
Tillerson has been described as having "close ties" to Putin, signed $500B energy deal, &amp; received Russia\'s \'order of friendship decoration\'
nominating Rex Tillerson to lead State Dept would raise serious questions #SecretaryOfState
Very concerned by @washingtonpost report on #RussianHackers. I support a full congressional review

Anything less than a full fix is a profound betrayal to our nation's coal miners -
RT @lauraolson: Bob Casey is among several Senate Dems vowing to block action until there's a vote on aiding retired coal miners:
We demand action to provide long-term certainty for these miners.
These miners cannot wait another day and it's up to us to protect what they've earned for a lifetime of dangerous, backbreaking work.
And for several months those calls have gone unanswered. -
For several months, we have joined thousands of retired coal miners &amp; their families to call for a vote on this bipartisan, paid-for bill.
I have substantial concerns about the nomination of Congressman Tom Price to be the Secretary of @HHSGov
