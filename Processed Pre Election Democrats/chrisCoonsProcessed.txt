About to join @MSNBC - tune in!
(5/5) Senate Foreign Relations Committee owes it to the American people to conduct thorough, detailed confirmation hearings on Mr. Tillerson
(4/5) Russia is not a business partner - it is an adversary of the US working hard to undermine democratic values around the world
(2/5) Given Mr. Tillerson's long friendship w Putin &amp; Pres-elect's dismissal of clear evidence Russia sought to influence US election...
(1/5) Rex Tillerson has decades of int'l business experience. Business experience is valuable, but different from fighting for US interests
Here's my full statement on President-elect Trump's nomination of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State:
(3/3) As Trademarks Caucus co-chair, I applaud IPEC Danny Marti for his report on counterfeiting, how it hurts consumers &amp; what to do abt it

(3/4)\xe2\x80\xa6 at a time when we need to be direct &amp; tough w Russia, given recent credible reports of Russian efforts to interfere in our democracy
(2/4) Still, I'm deeply concerned that Mr. Tillerson's long &amp; close ties to Russia and Putin could unduly influence his decision making\xe2\x80\xa6
(1/4) I'm committed to giving Pres-elect's nominees full &amp; fair consideration &amp; Mr. Tillerson would bring years of int'l business experience
