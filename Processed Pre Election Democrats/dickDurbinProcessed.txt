I agree with our President-elect \xe2\x80\x93 it's time to retire this electoral relic
The NPVIC is an agreement between states to award all their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the popular vote
Americans who want to see Electoral College reform can start by encouraging their state to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact
We face an uphill battle in Congress to reform the Electoral College, so it's up to states to show leadership &amp; act

A week before the 2000 election, I intro'd a bipartisan bill to amend the Constitution &amp; create a system of direct election for presidents
You'd say that is fundamentally unfair, that we live in a nation that's 1 person, 1 vote\xe2\x80\x93but that's exactly what the Electoral College does
A relic from a shameful period in our nation's history, the Electoral College allows some votes to carry greater weight than others
As @nytopinion states, the Electoral College \xe2\x80\x9cis a living symbol of America's original sin\xe2\x80\x9d, created when slavery was the law of the land

The American people deserve to know that their POTUS is putting the US's interests before his own, his family's, or that of any foreign govt
Just this week @realDonaldTrump cancelled a scheduled announcement abt severing his business ties, taking time instead to meet w/ @kanyewest

If the investigation finds evidence that Russian officials perpetrated or directed such acts, appropriate criminal charges must be announced
The American people deserve transparency and reassurance that federal law enforcement is actively investigating these matters
We strongly support calls for immediate bipartisan investigations by Congress\xe2\x80\x94this requires the full attention of the exec. &amp; leg. branches
We also call on @LorettaLynch to publicly confirm if a criminal investigation of Russian interference is underway:
We are calling for a National Intelligence Estimate from @ODNIgov to be publicly released by Jan 20\xe2\x80\x93the American people deserve the truth
